# Bug Identifier iOS App

## Overview

Bug Identifier is an iOS application designed to help users identify various types of bugs using their iPhone's camera or photo library. Users can snap a picture or select an existing one, and the app (with future API integration) will provide information about the identified insect.

This project is built using SwiftUI and aims to provide a modern, intuitive user experience.

## Features

*   **Personalized Onboarding**: Asks users about their primary interest in bug identification (e.g., general curiosity, gardening, pest control, learning) to tailor the experience.
*   **Camera & Gallery Integration**: Allows users to either capture a new photo of a bug or select an image from their device's photo gallery.
*   **Results Display**: A dedicated screen to show information about the identified bug, including its name, confidence of identification, description, habitat, and whether it's poisonous (currently uses placeholder data).
*   **Modern UI**: Clean and user-friendly interface built with SwiftUI.
*   **Persistent Preferences**: User's onboarding completion status and selected interest are saved locally.
*   **Firebase Ready**: Includes basic Firebase setup (`FirebaseCore`) for potential future backend integration (e.g., analytics, remote configuration, or user-specific data).

## Technologies Used

*   **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface and application flow.
*   **Swift**: The primary programming language.
*   **PhotosUI**: For accessing the photo library (`PHPickerViewController`).
*   **AVFoundation**: (Implicitly for camera access via `UIImagePickerController`)
*   **FirebaseCore**: Basic integration for Firebase services.
*   **Xcode**: Development environment.

## Project Structure

*   `BugIdentifierApp.swift`: The main entry point of the application, including Firebase initialization.
*   `ContentView.swift`: The root view that manages the display of either the onboarding or the main app content.
*   `OnboardingView.swift`: Handles the initial user onboarding process, including collecting user interests.
*   `CameraGalleryView.swift`: Provides options to use the camera or photo gallery and initiates the bug identification process.
*   `ResultsView.swift`: Displays the (currently placeholder) results of the bug identification.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone (https://github.com/josephmp5/bugidentifier)
    ```
2.  **Open in Xcode**:
    *   Navigate to the cloned project directory.
    *   Open the `bugidentifier.xcodeproj` file (or `bugidentifier.xcworkspace` if you have CocoaPods or other workspace-generating dependencies, though currently it seems to be Swift Package Manager based).
3.  **Install Firebase SDK (if not automatically resolved)**:
    *   The project is set up to use Swift Package Manager for Firebase. If Xcode doesn't fetch it automatically:
        *   Go to **File > Add Packages...**
        *   Enter the Firebase iOS SDK repository URL: `https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git`
        *   Add `FirebaseCore` and any other Firebase products you intend to use to your app's target.
4.  **Run the App**:
    *   Select a simulator or connect a physical iOS device.
    *   Click the "Play" button (or press Command + R) to build and run the application.

Upon first launch, you'll be guided through the onboarding process. After completing it, you can use the camera or gallery to select an image. The app will then navigate to a results page (currently with sample data).

## Future Enhancements

*   **AI API Integration**: Connect the image selection to an actual bug identification AI API.
*   **Dynamic Results**: Populate the `ResultsView` with real data obtained from the API.
*   **Personalized Content**: Utilize the user's selected interest from onboarding to customize the app experience or the information displayed.
*   **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API calls and image processing.
*   **User Accounts**: (Optional) Allow users to create accounts to save their identification history.
*   **Offline Mode**: (Optional) Store some bug data locally for offline access.
